After submitting the form, the credentials are stored, and the application can begin fetching data.\nThis self-registration page can be customized with three images, a custom title, a message, and placeholder text for each credential input:\ndeddie-self-registration-page.png Since the Tax number is the primary key for identifying a user in the DEDDIE API, this page also serves as the entry point for updating an access token once it expires.\nWhen a user submits the form, the provided data is validated against the DEDDIE API. If validation succeeds, the setup is complete, and during the next data-fetch cycle, the userâ€™s data will be retrieved.\n","pageTitle":"Self-registration and token renewal","metaDescription":"","type":"Documentation","breadcrumbs":"Users guide///Modules","root":0,"depth":2}
