# Modules

esthesis EDGE integrates with third-party systems through modules. A module allows esthesis EDGE to communicate with a
third-party system, such as a database, a cloud service, or a device, and fetch data from it.

If you want to integrate a third-party system into esthesis EDGE, please
suggest so in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/esthesis-iot/esthesis-edge/issues).

The following modules are currently available:
- [Enedis module](enedis.md), providing integration with [Enedis DataHub API](https://datahub-enedis.fr).
